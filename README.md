# STRATO Mercata Token Standards

Welcome to the STRATO Mercata Token Standards repository, where we are pioneering the future of blockchain asset management. Our token standard is not just an innovationâ€”it's a revolution in how real-world assets (RWAs) are handled on the blockchain.

## Overview

The STRATO Mercata standards introduce a UTXO-based token model that advances traceability, security, and scalability. With our unique Sale contract feature, users can transfer assets securely while maintaining complete control over their transactions.

## Features

- **Assets**: Manages real world assets with granularity.
- **Enums**: Enumerated types that define a set of named constants for better code clarity.
- **Orders**: Create and manage sales with ease, thanks to our intuitive structuring.
- **Payments**: Secure and streamlined payment structures for efficient transaction processing.
- **Sales**: Sale contract mechanism that facilitates secure trading of RWAs and ownership transfer of assets.
- **Utils**: A collection of utility functions and libraries to assist in smart contract development.

## Groundbreaking Benefits

- Enhanced **Traceability**: Track the lifecycle of each asset with a transparent and unalterable ledger.
- Increased **Security**: Conduct transactions with the confidence that comes from robust cryptographic standards.
- Improved **Liquidity**: Realize the true value of your assets with flexible and liquid market structures.
- **Scalability**: Our UTXO-based model is designed to handle a high volume of transactions without compromising speed or reliability.
